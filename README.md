# Yamini Sathpadi - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hello, This is Yamini Sathpadi! As a recent Master's degree in Business Analytics graduate, I have a solid background and a great interest in using data to provide insightful information.  As an entry-level data or business systems specialist, I am thrilled to contribute my technical and analytical abilities to the data science sector.

 I improved my capacity to handle intricate data and sharpened my ability to spot patterns and trends while I was a student.  Additionally, I acquired expertise in statistical analysis and data management, which I think would be very helpful in my position as a data specialist.
 
I like to experiment with new data analysis tools and methods, and I'm constantly searching for ways to increase my expertise and efficiency.  Whether working in a group or alone, I am motivated by the excitement of learning new things and the fulfillment that comes from applying data to solve challenging issues.
